# About project

Demo- https://relaxed-wiles-6f9421.netlify.app/

This app shows information about countries all over the world using REST Countries API. I've done that with Angular, it contains cool features like dark and light theme switching and countries dynamic filtering and route animation. 

While doing this project I learned how to create custom pipes and created theme switching which saves state into local storage.
